This project is the result of a day or two of labor setting a polycode project to use for Mini-LD #29. However, with my inexperience with this framework, that only turned into this and theres really not much here. I'll probably continue to poke and expand on it as I go along.

Theres something wrong with the way I'm doing input at the moment, so it lags if you look and move at the same time. Not really sure whats up with that.

Anyway, expect this to expand in the future.
